# Weather App

## Project Overview
The Weather App is a web application that provides real-time weather information for various cities and countries. It integrates with a weather API to fetch data and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Users can search for weather data by entering city or country names.

## Application Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
weather-app
├── src
│   ├── app.ts                # Main entry point of the application
│   ├── services
│   │   ├── apiService.ts     # Handles API requests and responses
│   │   └── cacheService.ts   # Implements local caching of weather data
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── WeatherDisplay.ts  # Renders weather information on the webpage
│   │   └── SearchBar.ts      # Allows users to search for weather data
│   ├── styles
│   │   └── main.css          # CSS styles for the application
│   └── types
│       └── weatherData.ts    # TypeScript interfaces for weather data
├── public
│   └── index.html            # Main HTML file for the web application
├── package.json              # Configuration file for npm
├── tsconfig.json             # Configuration file for TypeScript
└── README.md                 # Documentation for the project
```

## Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web application.
- **Weather API**: To fetch real-time weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
- **Local Storage**: For caching weather data to optimize API calls.

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd weather-app
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure you have a valid API key for the weather service you choose to use.
- Modify the API service configuration in `src/services/apiService.ts` to include your API key and endpoint.
